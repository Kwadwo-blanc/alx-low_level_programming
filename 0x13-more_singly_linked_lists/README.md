A singly linked list is a linear data structure in which the elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations and each element is connected only to its next element using a pointer. In C, we can define a singly linked list using a structure that contains two fields: `data` and `next`. The `data` field stores the value of the node, while the `next` field stores the address of the next node in the list.
